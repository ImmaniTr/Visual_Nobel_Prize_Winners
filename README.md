# Visual_Nobel_Prize_Winners

En this work, a dataset showing Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2016 is analyzed. Temporal trends are examined, such as the birthplace of the winners. Initially, European winners predominated, but over time (shown by decades), the United States began to gain ground, becoming the country with the most awards. Another important data point analyzed is gender. Originally, male recipients dominated the prizes, but through a chart, the categorized progress that women made is displayed, showing significant advancements in categories such as the Nobel Peace Prize, literature, and medicine. The first woman to win a Nobel Prize, Marie Curie, is highlighted.

To conclude the analysis, a table of individuals who have won multiple Nobel Prizes is presented, as well as a graphical and categorized analysis of the age of the winners. Several trends are shown: for the physics category, the age has been increasing, for literature and economics, it remains constant, but for the peace prize, the winners are increasingly younger. As an interesting fact, Leonid Hurwicz is presented as the oldest person to win a Nobel Prize in the economics category at 90 years old, and Malala Yousafzai as the youngest winner at just 17 years old, receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.
